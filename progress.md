## Completed

### Foundation
- [x] Next.js project scaffolded with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, ShadCN
- [x] Supabase client (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`) with graceful no-key fallback
- [x] Session middleware (`src/proxy.ts`) — Next.js 16 requires function named `proxy`, not `middleware`
- [x] Dark mode auto-detection via inline `<script>` in `<head>`, `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`
- [x] `next.config.ts` with `picsum.photos` remote image pattern
- [x] Demo data fallback throughout — app works without Supabase or Claude keys

### Design System (`src/app/globals.css`)
- [x] CSS custom property layer: `--surface-page/card/raised/header` (light + dark)
- [x] Warm-tinted shadow system: `--shadow-card/elevated/float/deep` via `@utility` classes
- [x] `border-soft` / `border-medium` utilities (rgba, auto dark-switches)
- [x] Deep warm dark mode: `#0D0B09` page, `#181512` card, `#1E1B17` raised
- [x] Updated oklch tokens for richer contrast and muted colors
- [x] Tap highlight removed globally; font antialiasing on body
- [x] `.scroll-hide` carousel utility

### Navigation
- [x] `BottomNav` — floating glass pill, `shadow-float`, `backdrop-blur-24px`, active tab auto-inverts via `bg-foreground text-background`

### Home Screen (`/home`)
- [x] `ChildProfileHeader` — gradient header, avatar with mood badge, focus + weather badges, animated day-progress bar; tappable focus badge opens inline `FocusArea` chip picker (language / sensory / movement / practical-life / creativity); selecting a chip updates `ActivityPlan` in real-time
- [x] `RecommendationCard` — replaces AICard; live `nextBestAction` fetch with guidance layer, expandable "Why this works" section, share/approval action bar (idle → shared | awaiting); AI `flagForApproval` auto-sets awaiting state
- [x] `ActivityPlan` — horizontal snap scroll of 3 Montessori-area activity cards; responds to `focus` prop from page; each card has Start → active → Done state machine + Swap button (swaps to alternativeTitle/alternativeDescription inline); `GuidanceTag` per card; live `activityPlan` AI fetch; falls back to `dailyActivities` demo data
- [x] `QuickActions` — Quick Note + Add Item buttons
- [x] `MomentsCarousel` — horizontal snap scroll, photo + note card types
- [x] `TimelineFeed` — timeline with colored dots, active amber bar, NOW badge, done states
- [x] `InsightStrip` — ambient single-sentence AI observation below timeline, fades in at 700ms
- [x] `page.tsx` — converted to `"use client"`, lifts `focus: FocusArea` state shared between `ChildProfileHeader` (selector) and `ActivityPlan` (consumer)

### Memory / Journal Screen (`/memory`)
- [x] Three-tab interface: **Today** / **This Week** / **Favorites** with AnimatePresence crossfade
- [x] Page header — live date display ("Thursday, May 14"), editorial "Mateo's Journal" label, backdrop-blur; no border-b utility look
- [x] `DatePicker` — bottom-sheet modal with "Today / This week" shortcuts + last 4 weeks + last 4 individual days; selects past day or past week view
- [x] `PastDayView` — renders a single past date's journal entries from `dailySummaries` + `recentMemories` demo data; back button returns to tab view
- [x] `PastWeekView` — renders a labeled past week (e.g. "Last week · May 5–11"); back button returns
- [x] View state machine: `{ type: "tab" | "day" | "week" }` drives header title, back button visibility, and AnimatePresence content swap
- [x] `JournalSummary` — dark gradient AI summary card, `24px` headline, highlight pills, care notes (Sleep / Nutrition / Growth); live `dailySummary` + `insights` fetch; subtle AI attribution badge at footer
- [x] `TodayJournal` — full-bleed `3:4` hero photo (no border-radius, edge-to-edge); milestone as centered typographic panel with `36px` ✦ glyph + generous `py-14`; notes with `56px` serif `"` drop mark + no card background; secondary photos inset `mx-4 rounded-[1.5rem]`
- [x] `WeekView` — all photos full-bleed (first per day `3:4` portrait, subsequent `16:9` landscape); milestones + notes rendered as open typographic sections with no card backgrounds; day headers `px-5` inline
- [x] `WeeklyRecap` — replaces `WeeklyInsightCard`; milestone highlights strip (up to 4 ✦ items from `weeklyMoments`); skills-practiced chips derived from activity categories (learning→Language, outdoor→Gross Motor, etc.); retains live AI pattern observations
- [x] `FavoritesView` — `3:4` featured hero, first extra photo full-width, remaining in `2-col` grid; milestone pull-quotes with `56px` serif `"` drop mark + `22px` text in warm cream cards

### Trusted Caregiving Intelligence (`src/lib/ai/guidance.ts`, `src/components/ui/GuidanceTag.tsx`)
- [x] `guidance.ts` — typed `GuidanceSource` registry: CDC 15–18 mo., CDC 18–24 mo., AAP early childhood, WHO nurturing care, General developmental practice; each entry has label, description, ageRange, and honest `disclaimer` ("informed by, not prescribed by"); structured as hook point for future real data
- [x] `GuidanceTag` — tappable framework pill, color-coded by source (emerald/sky/teal/stone); tap expands inline context panel with description + disclaimer; `static` prop disables expansion for nested use
- [x] `nextBestAction` prompt updated to return `developmentalReason`, `guidanceSource`, `ageRange`, `flagForApproval`; model instructed to name the aligning framework, never claim prescription, never flag approval without genuine parent-input need
- [x] `RecommendationCard` guidance layer: `GuidanceTag` below developmental note; "Why this works" toggle reveals `developmentalReason` + "Aligned with…" static tag; `guidanceSource` validated against known values before use
- [x] `demo.ts` `aiSuggestion` enriched with `developmentalReason`, `guidanceSource`, `ageRange`, `flagForApproval`

### Collaborative Journal (`src/components/memory/`)
- [x] `ReactionBar` — 4 emoji reactions (❤️ 🥹 😂 ✨); toggle state with per-author tracking (current user = "nanny"); active chip: amber background; renders on milestone panels and note cards
- [x] `ReplyThread` — threaded reply composer on journal entries; shows last 2 replies collapsed with "N earlier replies" expand; reply input shows Send button only when text present; new replies appended to local state; AuthorBadge dot per reply
- [x] `TodayJournal` — milestone panels and note cards now include `ReactionBar` + `ReplyThread`; photos remain editorial only
- [x] `WeekView` — same interaction model carried into week-view milestones and notes

### Activity Planning (`src/lib/ai/prompts/activityPlan.ts`)
- [x] `activityPlan` AI prompt — returns 3 Montessori-area activities with `title`, `area`, `description`, `duration`, `materials`, `guidanceSource`, `alternativeTitle`, `alternativeDescription`; child-led exploration framing, age-appropriate, no prescriptive language
- [x] `/api/ai` route — added `activityPlan` branch; `max_tokens` raised 512 → 1024

### User Attribution (`src/components/ui/AuthorBadge.tsx`)
- [x] `AuthorBadge` — shared component: `nanny` (amber, "E", "Elena"), `parent` (rose, "S", "Sofia"), `ai` (violet, Sparkles icon, "Claude")
- [x] `inline` variant — circle + name + optional time; `dot` variant — circle only for photo overlays; `light` prop for dark/photo backgrounds
- [x] `TodayJournal` — attribution in hero + inset photo captions, milestone panels, and note card bylines; data-driven from `moment.createdBy`
- [x] `WeekView` — all moment types carry attribution; parent-captured Sunday/Monday evening entries visually distinct from nanny entries
- [x] `FavoritesView` — attribution on featured hero overlay and milestone pull-quote footers
- [x] `JournalSummary` — `opacity-50` AI badge at card footer distinguishes AI-generated content from human entries
- [x] `TimelineFeed` — `opacity-70` author badge below logged notes on done/active schedule items
- [x] `demo.ts` — `createdBy` added to `JournalMoment` interface + all `weeklyMoments`; `favoriteMemories` tagged `parent`; `loggedBy` on done/active schedule items

### Schedule Screen (`/schedule`)
- [x] Two-section layout: Upcoming / Completed
- [x] `ScheduleBlock` — colored left accent bar, time, type pill, NOW badge, check circle
- [x] Converted to `"use client"` with `useEffect` Supabase fetch; typed `ScheduleItem` + safe `normalize()` function
- [x] Date picker integration — calendar icon in header opens `DatePicker`; selecting a past day filters schedule to that date with back-navigation

### Lists Screen (`/lists`)
- [x] Grocery list with round checkbox toggle, completed section
- [x] Sticky add-item input bar with arrow-up submit button
- [x] Optimistic UI updates + Supabase sync

### AI Integration (`src/lib/ai/`)
- [x] `src/app/api/ai/route.ts` — unified POST handler for `dailyPlan`, `dailySummary`, `nextBestAction`, `insights`; try/catch, no-key guard, `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- [x] `src/lib/ai/client.ts` — `callAI()` with error handling (returns `null` on failure); `parseAIJson()` helper (strips markdown fences)
- [x] Prompts: `generateDailyPlan`, `dailySummary`, `nextBestAction`, `insights`
- [x] System prompt rewritten: observer voice, specific-to-this-child framing, no "Research shows"
- [x] All AI surfaces render demo data instantly; Claude silently upgrades on success

### Demo Data (`src/lib/data/demo.ts`)
- [x] `child`, `schedule` (6 items with done/active states), `moments` (6 items)
- [x] `groceryItems`, `aiSuggestion` (with `developmentalNote` + `developmentalFocus`)
- [x] `todayInsights`, `weeklyPatterns`, `careNotes`
- [x] `aiJournalSummary`, `weeklyMoments` (4 days, 12 moments), `favoriteMemories` (6 items)
- [x] `typeConfig` (meal/outdoor/play/nap/learning → color + dot + label)
- [x] `MomentReaction` + `MomentReply` interfaces; reactions/replies seeded on `t2` (milestone) and `t4` (note)
- [x] `FocusArea` type + `focusAreas` array; `MontessoriArea` + `PlannedActivity` interfaces; `dailyActivities` (3 activities across language/sensory/practical-life); `areaConfig` with colors + icons per area

---

- [x] `supabase/setup.sql` — single combined DDL file: drops all tables in dependency order, recreates with correct TEXT ids, installs RLS helper functions + all policies; resolves circular dependency between schema and RLS files
- [x] Live Supabase project seeded at `mgbzsikninkwmlqtastg.supabase.co`

### Voice Input Layer (`src/hooks/`, `src/lib/voice/`, `src/components/voice/`)
- [x] `useVoiceInput` hook — SpeechRecognition wrapper with `idle/listening/done/error/unsupported` states
- [x] `src/lib/voice/speechRecognition.ts` — engine abstraction; `createRecognition()` is the Whisper swap point
- [x] `src/lib/voice/transcriptParser.ts` — grocery item extraction (comma + "and" splitting), activity category detection, time extraction from schedule phrases
- [x] `VoiceButton` — pure UI mic button; `pill` variant (circular, inline) and `row` variant (full-width labeled)
- [x] `VoiceInputModal` — spring-animated bottom sheet: 4-bar waveform, live blinking cursor, editable transcript, haptic `navigator.vibrate` on save, "Saved ✓" auto-dismiss
- [x] `VoiceRecorder` — orchestrator: wires `useVoiceInput` + `transcriptParser` + the two UI components
- [x] Lists page — mic pill in input bar; one utterance adds multiple items with staggered optimistic inserts
- [x] Memory page — mic pill in header next to PhotoUploader; saves note to Supabase `memory_events`
- [x] QuickActions (home) — full-width voice row beneath text buttons; routes to grocery or activity log based on parsed intent

### Security — Row Level Security (`supabase/rls.sql`)
- [x] `households` table — one row per family, fixed demo UUID `11111111-...`
- [x] `household_members` table — maps `auth.users.id` → household + role (`parent` | `nanny`)
- [x] `children` — `household_id` column added, FK to `households`
- [x] Helper functions: `my_household_id()`, `my_role()`, `in_my_household(child_id)` — keep policies readable
- [x] RLS enabled on all 7 tables with per-operation policies
- [x] Nannies: read all, create memories + grocery items, update schedule — no delete
- [x] Parents: full read/write on all tables, manage members
- [x] Cross-household isolation enforced at DB level — no app-level enforcement needed

## Known / Deferred

- [ ] Real authentication (Supabase Auth) — currently `child_id: "default"` everywhere; `household_members` inserts needed after auth users created
- [ ] Photo upload to Supabase Storage (`PhotoUploader.tsx` is wired but untested without keys)
- [ ] `.env.local` not in repo — app runs on demo data without it
- [ ] `MemoryCard.tsx` placeholder component not yet used
- [ ] `FloatingActions.tsx` — referenced in earlier build; removed from current home layout
- [ ] Push notifications for nanny → parent updates
- [ ] Multi-child support
